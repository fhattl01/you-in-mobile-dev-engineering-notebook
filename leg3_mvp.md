# Leg 3: Minimum Viable Product

We have implemented all of the critical views for the youin application. 
Users can create a profile, add friends, and create and recieve events. 
The application has a usable UIand can be navigated intuitively. The two 
biggest improvements that need to be made are the addition of push 
notifications when a user recieves an event, and a better way to search for 
and add friends. Initially we planned to integrate with facebook to help a 
user add friends, but now we believe that the best method is to store the 
user's phone number in their profile and then suggest friends based on 
contacts that the user has in their phone. These features are not necessary 
in the minimum viable product, but would be very nice to have by the time we 
launch on the Play Store because they would vastly improve the user 
experience.
