# Engineering Notebook November 20

This past week we pushed out application to the Google Play Store. It was incredibly rewarding to finally push our code to production which will allow people to use it in the real world. One of the biggest things we learned from the process of moving our code to production, is that many of the key aspects of mobile development have nothing to do with writing code. One of the most important features of any application is its marketplace presence. We spent time taking screenshots in the app to help communicate the features of the app. We wrote a compelling description that is intended to convince users to download the app. We designed an attractive icon so that the app will look professional and draw users in. Most importantly we learned that marketing the application and development go hand in hand. A great feature set is only useful when people actually use it. It was great to get an introduction to the marketing side of application development this week.
