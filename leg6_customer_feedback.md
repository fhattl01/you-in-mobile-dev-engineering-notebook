#Leg 6: Customer Feedback 

#Lessons Learned
By November 30, we have had 4 active installs by user. We have learned that
we need to fix our Manage Friends Activity because there is an error with a 
Null Pointer Exception. 

#Feedback 
Out of the 4 active installs, 2 have uninstalled the application. We had 1
crash in the application from a null pointer exception when a user tried to add
a new friend. 

We had 5 people testing our application: one on an android device and the
others on the Android Studio Emulator. 

One of our usability testers said they would use the application, but since
none of his friends had the app he couldn't actually send out any invitations. 

The android device user said he enjoyed the color scheme and found the application
easy to navigate, but would have liked for the "Going"/"Not Going" buttons on the 
homepage to have been more clear clickable buttons. 

Users generally liked how the app was organized from oldest events to upcoming/most recent events being shown at the top of the list.
