#October 15-22 Engineering Notebook 

Created backend for event and profile creation. Worked on setting up backend
for adding friends. Made a manage friends page with scrollable view of friends 
and a scrollable event list. Also created a profile view activity. 

The largest challenge was setting up a database manager that contained all of 
the necessary functions for communicating with the firebase database. Another 
challenge was setting up the friends list adapter. 

Out next step is to link the database to allow adding friends and to finish all
front end details.
