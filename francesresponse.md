#Reflection on this past semester

#What did you learn technically?
I feel my technical skills have grown a lot this semester. I came in with zero
experience with Java, Android studio or outside API usage, as I hadn't taken 
Comp 20 yet. My major technical accomplishment was learning how to use Android 
Studio - this was my first time learning a language/system different from C/C++. 

#What did you learn professionally? 
I learned how to work on a team to create a product. My only other team-coding experience was in Comp 40, where partners changed every 2 weeks. This was my first time working for an entire semester with one partner, which was an amazing experience professionally. I learned how to work collboratively with the same person and maintain a healthy and open working relationship. 
I also learned how to take a product from start to finish through design, coding, usability testing, and finally presenting the finished product to the world. This is a professional experience that I have had in no other classes I've taken. Learning from my mistakes and adjusting to create a better product was an extremely important learning experience. 

#What do you wish I could have done differently?
I think the course was very well taught and I loved the freedom to be creative and solve problems on our own. But I wish that we could've spent more time on React Native vs. Android. I felt much more comfortable with Android Studio after the first assignment, so it seemed like the obvious choice, but I wish I had learned more about React Native beforehand. I wish we would have coded more in React Native before the semester project, so that we could've done a more side-by-side comparison between Android Studio and React Native. 

#If you were to do this all over again, what would you do differently?
I would have liked to code this project in React Native so there could be at least somewhat of a possibility of publishing it to the Apple App Store. I also would have liked to do more usability testing with an actual android device to see how the app would function. 

If you could make one change to this Mobile Development course, what would it be and why?
I would have liked to have access to real mobile devices to test on, which I know is out of the budget of the course, but it still would have been nice.
Another thing that I think is both good and bad about the course is the amount of examples of work. While have more examples would have made making the app easier, I would not have gone out and learned so much if I had direct examples from the class.
